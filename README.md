# Java Practice Vault

This repository is a personal collection of Java coding practices, designed to store and organize solutions to various programming problems in a clean and structured manner.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following packages (folders):

- `strings/`: Contains solutions for string-related problems.
- `arrays/`: Contains solutions for array-based problems.
- `sorting/`: Contains implementations of various sorting algorithms.
- `numbers/`: Contains solutions for numeric logic, such as prime numbers, factorials, etc.

## How to Run Each File

Each Java file is self-contained and can be run independently. To run a specific file:

1. Open the `.java` file in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).
2. Right-click on the file.
3. Select "Run" or a similar option from the context menu.

Each file has a `main()` method that demonstrates the usage of the implemented solutions and prints the output to the console.
